            I am a third-year data science student at New York City College of
            Technology, CUNY and CUNY Tech Prep Alumni with real-world
            experience in data analysis, quality assurance, and data
            engineering. Within these experiences, I have worked to connect
            people with data in investigator and engineer roles. I am passionate
            about learning more about this world through different lenses
            especially through data.

            My goal is to discover, analyze and harness &mdash; the power of
            &apos;data&apos;. Data is undoubtedly the new gold of the era we
            live in.

            When I am not in front of a screen, Iâ€™m most likely enjoying the
            local food and wonderful weather while reading or listening to
            music.
